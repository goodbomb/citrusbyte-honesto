# CitrusByte - Honesto Mock Project

App Deployed to: https://immense-brushlands-71606.herokuapp.com/

## What was completed


## What was de-scoped due to time constraints
- The "Unknown" font-family
- The "Feedback period" filter on the Share Feedback page


## What could not be completed in time


## What I would have done with 1 week
- Implement a rudamentary API for data persistence
- Utilize Redux for the data store instead of localStorage
- More up-front planning and architectural design. With the time constraints, I didn't really have time to plan everything out well.

## What I would do differently if I did this again
- Implement each user flow immediately, with hard coded data first, and very little styling. Get the critical functionality working first, then add details and styles. I realized pretty quickly that I was wasting too much time in the beginning with making the app presentable, when I should have really been focused on the core functionality. It's been a while since I've had to "hack" an app together fast like this. I've been used to having time to architect a solution before building it.
